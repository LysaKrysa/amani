            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p><strong>Ep1:</strong><br>10 Brawlers trained together. One was limitlessly powerful, Hank. They were trained by Kenji. They went on a forest trip, a betrayal occurred.</p>
            <p><strong>Ep2:</strong><br>CORD was captured by Hank but survived since Hank's bubble isn't strong for now. Hank's goal is the Hyper Gem in Spike's body, the Hyper Gem allows him to use hypercharge.</p>
            <p><strong>Ep3:</strong><br>Night came, rains fell, bushes grew. They used bushes as shelter. Exploring in groups of 2, but Spike was caught & killed, even though Bibi was with him. Weird, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Ep4:</strong><br>Snow fell, Hank used his hypercharged super to pierce the bushes! It‚Äôs no longer safe. Hank now has the Hyper Gem, and he can use hypercharge now. The brawlers are sad they lost their shelter.</p>
            <p><strong>Ep5:</strong><br>Lou thought: How does Hank know everything about us? Unknown person: Mr. Bat says hi. *kicks on head* wakes up in a lab. Lou: HUH, where am I?</p>
            <p><strong>Ep6:</strong><br>Kenji: Welcome to the Lab Quest, Lou. Lou: Kenji?! KENJI?!?! You are one of them?!?! Kenji: Fool! Fool! Don't shout at your master. There is a countdown for a nuclear power plant in this lab to explode. If you complete the quest, the countdown stops. *uncuffs Lou* Lou: I have to do this... I can't die, I can't leave Kit, Charlie, Leon, Bibi, Frank, Buster, and Cord alone! *Runs towards the quest* <2 Minutes Left> 1 quest left. I have to find Kenji and finish the quests... No... 10s left... KENJI! KENJI SHOW UP PLEASEEEE... I am unappreciated... *Boom*</p>
            <p><strong>Ep7:</strong><br>Brawlers prepare to go across the islands to Bubble Island, home of Hank üèù. Midway in the sea, 5 pirate ships chase them. Bibi was one of the pirates sent by Hank and Kenji to take them down. The brawlers were shocked by the betrayal. Kit sadly fell... Farewell. They arrived at the island and saw Hank. To be continued...</p>
            <p><strong>Ep8 [Final]:</strong><br>They ran at Hank, but Kenji showed up to defend him. They fought Kenji first‚Äîhe was hard to defeat. Charlie was about to die, but Cord took him to the shadow realm. "Either die as a sacrificial hero or win as a hero." - Cord. CORD DID IT! WOOO! Bibi was a coward and escaped. Now, it was time for the Hank fight. Hank was furious and activated his hypercharged super, but Frank covered his friends. Everyone was safe, but Frank died as a hero ‚úåÔ∏è. Hank was about to be defeated, but something pulled him onto a ship, and he escaped... Who could have pulled him?</p>
