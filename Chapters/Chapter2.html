            <h2>Ep1:</h2>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> Who are you?! WHY DID YOU SAVE ME? I'M NOT WEAK TO YOU.</p>
            <p><strong>Gene:</strong> Hey hey, I saved your life. I am Gene, a member of one of the strongest pirate teams.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> You are very kind. You saved me, thank you.</p>
            <p><strong>Gene:</strong> Ay, I'm not kind, buddy. I saved you under some conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> What if I don't want to follow the conditions?</p>
            <p><strong>Gene:</strong> Then we will throw you in the middle of the ocean.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> Alright, alright. What do you want, genie guy?</p>
            <p><strong>Gene:</strong> I am NOT a genie, I'm Gene. The condition: help us, be one of us. Also, have you ever wanted to be small again and not tanky-shaped like that?</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> Yes, I want to be small, but how did you know?</p>
            <p><strong>Gene:</strong> Introducing you to Willow...</p>
            <p><strong>Willow:</strong> Hello, I am Willow. I can read minds and control minds, but controlling minds isn't as easy as you think. It makes me exhausted once I use it for like 10 seconds.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> Oh cool. Anything else? How can I be cured and be small again?</p>
            <p><strong>Willow:</strong> Go talk to Byron, leader and medic of this pirate team.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> (Walks towards Byron) Hello, you are Byron, right? Can you please cure my issue of being a tank?</p>
            <p><strong>Byron:</strong> Of course, but it might take long, and it might have consequences. Be patient, kid.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> I am an elder, you old brat!</p>
            <p><strong>Byron:</strong> Be respectful, kid. The water of the ocean can dissolve you.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> Dissolve me? How?!</p>
            <p><strong>Byron:</strong> Studies by Professor Carl showed that the ocean water eats your body.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> Oh, alright. CARL?! He's your scientist? I heard he's a very popular scientist for pirates. I'm glad he is our crewmate.</p>
            <p><strong>Byron:</strong> No, we stole his studies forcibly during the Fight of Triangle.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> Yuck. What is the Fight of Triangle though?</p>
            <p><strong>Byron:</strong> Later, you will understand when you are one of our members.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> Here we go, sailing in the Ocean of Brawl! Where is our destination?</p>
            <p><strong>Byron:</strong> Brawlia City!</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> HERE WE GO!!!</p>
            <h2>Ep2:</h2>
            <p><strong>Byron:</strong> ENEMIES! SHOOT!!!!</p>
            <p><strong>Edgar:</strong> Hey byron long time no see!</p>
            <p><strong>Byron:</strong> ...</p>
            <p><strong>Edgar:</strong> Silent right? It's time for your death, Blood Pirates will end now</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> No! STOP RIGHT THERE!</p>
            <p><strong>Edgar:</strong> Hank... The hypered?.. How could it be Runs to his ship back and they forfeit</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> what is your goal guys though</p>
            <p><strong>Byron:</strong> Once Upon.. there was a king, very powerful.. he had all the 20 power cubes, powercubes boost your power</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> they are called powercubes so they ofc boost your power ah!</p>
            <p><strong>Byron:</strong> since the king died, his powercubes went to hidden places everyone is looking for them, every 3 powercubes, you unlock a special ability or powerup.</p>
            <p><strong>Gene:</strong> I have 3 powercubes and I have the abillty to push people, not only pull people, and on the tenth powercube, you get a very powerful power, like mine at 10 powercubes, I be able to have Telekinesis, which is the abillty to control anything.</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> ZzZzZz Interesting topic but really long</p>
            <p>scene shifts into the runners</p>
            <p><strong>Cord:</strong> We must do something, we can't just keep hiding and running, this is it!!</p>
            <p><strong>Charlie, Leon:</strong> Yea!!!!</p>
            <p><strong>Cord:</strong> At 3 powercubes, I will be able to teleport my teammates to shadow realm, not just rivals, let's go on our trip to brawlia!</p>
            <p><strong>Leon, charlie:</strong> YEAHHHH!</p>
            <p>scene shifts to a doctor</p>
            <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> what is your name and what happened to you.</p>
            <p><strong>Patient:</strong> I am <em>Kenji</em> I was poisoned</p>
            <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> Sit down, we will do a surgery for you to get out the poisonous things in your stomach</p>
            <p><strong>Kenji:</strong> no no, not in my stomach, just generally in my body parts.</p>
            <p><strong>Doctor:</strong> OK..? Here we go.</p>
            <p>the surgery is done</p>
            <p>Blood Pirates arrive Brawlia city</p>
            <p><strong>Gene:</strong> Brawlia is the area of gold, it has the most powercubes, but they are extremely hidden in caves, underground or just anywhere; it's not easy.</p>
            <p><strong>Cord:</strong> shhh, leon, Charlie look, Hank is there with some people, Oh God..</p>
            <p><strong>Leon:</strong> let's listen to them</p>
            <p><strong>Gene:</strong> You see that powercube on top of the mountain? Go for it Hank and achieve it for me, don't consume it</p>
            <p><strong>Hank:</strong> Alright</p>
            <p><strong>Cord:</strong> Leon, be invisible and get the powercube before hank, we need that</p>
            <p><strong>Leon:</strong> Here I go!</p>
            <p>Leon Reaches the top</p>
            <p><strong>Leon:</strong> huh, 2 powercubes? ALRIGHT</p>
            <p>goes back down and gives it to cord</p>
            <p><strong>Cord:</strong> now I have the new abillty to take teammates to Shadow realm</p>
            <p><strong>Leon:</strong> didn't you say we have to get 3 for a new abillty?</p>
            <p><strong>Cord:</strong> I had 1 powercube, but where is Charlie..?</p>
            <p><strong>Charlie:</strong> RIGHT HERE, HA-HA-HA</p>
            <p>Both of them unconscious</p>
            <p><strong>To be continued...</strong></p>
            <h2>Ep3:</h2>
            <p>Cord wakes up in a strange lab-looking place</p>
